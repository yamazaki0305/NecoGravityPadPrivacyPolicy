Thank you for purchasing this additional theme for Mad Level Manager!

-- Usage --

Using additional themes in your project is easy! All you need to do is:

1. Have Mad Level Manager imported into your project. Be sure that you always have the latest version available!
2. Import purchased theme. Note that if you do this in reversed order you will see some errors, but they will be gone when Mad Level Manager is imported.
3. Duplicate example scene. You will see two example scenes in the theme directory. One for lanscape orientation, and one for portrait orientation. Please select the one you desire, and press CTRL+D to duplicate it.

Why it is important to duplicate an example scene? Because if you'll use the provided scene, there is a risk that your changes to this scene will be overwritten when you will reimport or update the theme package!

4. Move the duplicated scene whenever you want and name it whatever you want.
5. In this scene select the "Grid Layout", and in the inspector set "Configuration" to your current configuration.
